## SQL QUERY EDITOR

## üìö Description
Create, design and implement a web-based application capable of running SQL queries and displaying the results of said query. The application must include a space which accepts SQL queries in the form of user inputs, then runs the given query, and displays the result within the application.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Features
1. Lazy Loading for Table Data: During the initial load, the application retrieves the list of available tables, deferring the actual data retrieval until the user clicks on a specific table. This approach optimizes the initial loading time, providing a user-friendly experience by fetching and displaying data only upon request.
2. Fully functional SQL Code editor: A key functionality of our application is enabling users to input and execute their own SQL queries. This flexibility empowers users to interact with the database using personalized commands, catering to a variety of data analysis requirements.
 
3. Output Table Pagination: The application implements paginated table data presentation to improve the handling of large datasets. Instead of overwhelming users with an extensive list, the data is organized into manageable pages (20 per page), enhancing readability and navigation.

4. Saving the already used query output as memory cache: Simplify the querying process by saving and reusing predefined queries and tables within the application. This feature boosts efficiency and minimizes the need for repetitive input.

5. Data Export Capability: Our application allows users to export query results in JSON format, providing a convenient way to save and share data. Additionally, the feature to save queries eliminates the need for repetitive typing, enhancing user efficiency.

6. Elevated User Interface and Experience: Our project focused extensively on enhancing the UI/UX for the SQL query React app. Through meticulous attention to detail, we have elevated the visual aesthetics, streamlined navigation, and optimized user interactions. The result is a sophisticated and user-friendly environment, meticulously crafted to maximize user engagement and satisfaction.
